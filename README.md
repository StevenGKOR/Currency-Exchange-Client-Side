Currency-Exchange-React-App is a frontend application built using React.js that allows users to convert currencies in real-time. 
It communicates with a server-side API to retrieve currency exchange rates.

The user interface is simple and intuitive, featuring a dropdown menu for selecting the base currency and the target currency, 
as well as an input field for the amount to be converted. The converted amount is displayed in real-time, without the need for refreshing the page.

The application utilizes Axios, a promise-based HTTP client, to communicate with the server-side API. The API provides currency exchange rates based on the European Central Bank's data. The rates are updated daily, ensuring that the application always provides the most up-to-date information.

The project uses modern web development practices, including modular CSS using SCSS and JSX syntax for creating React components. It also includes error handling to alert the user in case of incorrect input or failed API requests.

Overall, Currency-Exchange-React-App is a straightforward and useful tool for users looking to convert currencies in real-time.
